Using the web framework and language of your choice, and a SQLite database (a file), please create a web application.

Using the three attached files (names.txt, instruments.csv, and name_instrument.csv), please write code that:

1. Parses and loads the Names into one table, and the Instruments into another table. Note, when commas exist in the
names.txt file, they separate "last, first".  Otherwise, it's "first last".
2. Parses and loads the name_instrument.csv file, and create database-level associations between the Instruments,
and the characters playing those instruments.

Then, using your framework, please create a "homepage" that is a list of the following reports.
When clicking on these links, the user should be prompted to download a csv file.

1. A file showing the name, instrument, and section for all musicians.
2. A file showing the instruments that don't yet have musicians (i.e. no one plays the trumpet), and their sections,
sorted by section, alphabetically in ascending order.
3. A file showing any musicians that play two or more instruments, their instrument, and section.
4. A file showing any instruments that are played by multiple musicians, as well as the musician names and sections.
